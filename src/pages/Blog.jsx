          <h3>What To Take When You Downsize Your Home</h3>
          <p>
            When you decide to downsize to a new house, one of your biggest
            decisions is what to bring with you, and what to leave behind.
            Before you start packing, plan ahead and take only the items you
            will use and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are like many others, you may have accumulated a ton of stuff
            that you no longer need - or want. Maybe the kids are off to college
            and no longer playing baseball, or you might not be interested in
            the activities you once enjoyed. Moving to a new downsized home is a
            good time to clear the clutter and take Marie Kondo's advice by only
            moving with the things that "spark joy."

          <h3>Consider your Lifestyle</h3>
          <p>
            Moving to a smaller home is the time to be realistic when you decide
            whether to take or leave seldom used items. Keep in mind that
            technology has helped downsize many activities, and a smaller
            keyboard may be just the thing to replace a large piano. You may
            also be at the point where you want to spend time enjoying cultural
            events and making social connections.
          </p>
          <h3>Dispense with Unwanted Items</h3>
          <p>
            Start by creating three piles - things you definitely want to keep,
            things you definitely want to get rid of, and things you are
            undecided about. Stay organized and sell or donate items that are
            still usable and in pretty good condition, and place useless items
            in the recycle bin. Then tackle the "undecided" pile and be
            realistic about what you will use in your new life, and what you may
            not.

          <h3>Measure your New Space</h3>
          <p>
            As much as you might love your beautiful oversized sectional, it is
            a good idea to assess your new space to make sure your existing
            furniture will fit without blocking doors and windows. A small-scale
            dinette set, a stylish new loveseat, a coffee table to replace the
            old one and a beautiful new cabinet to store your possessions behind
            closed doors might serve you better than your existing furniture.
          </p>
          <h3>Think about Moving Costs</h3>
          <p>
            Before you decide to take large and heavy furniture with you,
            consider whether it is worthwhile to pay for moving costs. You may
            be better off selling the items and using the proceeds to buy
            something new that will be more stylish and useful in your new home,
            like a media cabinet or a multipurpose sleeper sofa.

          <h3>Stay Organized</h3>
          <p>
            Reduce the stress of your move by creating a moving checklist to
            keep track of things you need to do during your move, like canceling
            utilities. Even if you hire a mover, there are things you may want
            to pack yourself. Make sure to have the right tools, like boxes,
            markers, labels and packing tape. Cardboard wardrobes can be real
            time saver for both packing and unpacking.

          <h3>Add Color and Texture</h3>
          <p>
            Unexpected colors and textures can go a long way in making your home
            unique and attractive. A pop of color in an otherwise neutral room
            can make a dramatic statement. Don't feel that you must add the
            color that is currently trending, since trends come and go. Use a
            color that fits your room and sets the tone you want. Textured rugs,
            throw blankets and woven items also add a layer of comfort and
            style.
